# BTWN U+I

## Introduction 
Meeting up with friends can be tough, sometimes if you live far away from each other it wouldn’t be convenient for one person to travel much more than the other. Regular map applications don’t offer the option to view things to do that are along the route of both points. Search for things to do between two locations using the new BTWN U+I App!

## Technologies Used
